\begin{abstract}
We present a new \textit{lock-free} algorithm for concurrent manipulation of a binary search tree in an asynchronous shared memory system that supports search, insert and delete operations. Our algorithm uses (single-word) compare-and-swap (CAS) and bit-test-and-set (BTS) atomic instructions, both of which are commonly supported by many modern processors including Intel 64 and AMD64. We minimize conflicts by marking \textit{edges} rather than \textit{nodes}. We also reduce memory footprint by a factor of 2 by using an internal representation of a binary search tree. Compared to existing \textit{lock-free} algorithms, our algorithm uses fewer atomic instructions in the absence of conflicts. Our experiments indicate that our \textit{lock-free} algorithm significantly outperforms all other algorithms for a concurrent binary search tree in many cases, by as much as 70$\%$.
